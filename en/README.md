# Zero Trust IoT by Formal Verification and System Software
CREST Research Area: [\[Society 5.0 System Software\] Creation of System Software for Society 5.0 by Integrating Fundamental Theories and System Platform Technologies](https://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/crest/en/research_area/ongoing/area2021-2.html)

## Topics

## Research Outline
This project aims to realize secure Internet of Things (IoT) systems in accordance with the concept of zero trust by the fusion of formal verification and system software technologies.
In the formal verification research, we provide mathematical proofs for the legitimacy of IoT trust chains and address unknown threats combining static and dynamic verification. 
In the system software research, we develop mechanisms for isolated execution, automatic detection, and automatic countermeasure in conjunction with the theoretical results in order to demonstrate zero trust IoT. 
We also promote social acceptance of IoT by ensuring the accountability.
